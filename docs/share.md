Welcome to the **Share Your Plugin** section of the Gyre SDK documentation. Here, you'll learn how to distribute your plugins and share them with the Gyre community.

## Distributing Your Plugins

To distribute your plugins, we use the ComfyUI Manager. The ComfyUI Manager helps in managing and distributing Gyre plugins, along with optional ComfyUI nodes, workflows, and AI models. This makes it easy for other users to find and use your plugins within the Gyre application.

### What is ComfyUI Manager?

The ComfyUI Manager is a tool that facilitates the distribution of ComfyUI extensions, which include Gyre plugins. It allows you to package your plugins and any additional resources (such as nodes, workflows, and AI models) into a single extension that can be easily managed and distributed.

### How to Distribute Your Plugins Using ComfyUI Manager

1. **Prepare Your Plugin:**
   - Ensure your plugin is fully functional and well-documented.
   - Package any additional resources (nodes, workflows, AI models) that are required for your plugin.

2. **Package Your Plugin:**
   - Follow the guidelines provided by the ComfyUI Manager to package your plugin and additional resources into a ComfyUI extension.

3. **Submit Your Plugin:**
   - Once your plugin is published as a GitHub project, you can submit it to the Gyre community through the ComfyUI Manager as a ComfyUI extension.
